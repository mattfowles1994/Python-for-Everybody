Python for Everybody - Coursera Course (Charles Severance)
Pieces of code written whilst completing the Python for Everybody course

This course started from the very basics such as string manipulation, but soon enough I learnt some SQLite and began making databases

musicddatabase.py was my program for parsing through the vast quantities of music I have on my PC and storing this information on a database.
